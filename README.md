## MVP

- Create a puzzle level. Each level will be made up of multiple rooms.
	- Rooms can contain spikes, moving platforms, collectible coins, or dissolving platforms
		(that disappear a second after they player stands on them)
	- The player can exit the room in any direction, and will walk or fall into an adjacent room
		when they do so.
	- Each room will contain one or more checkpoints. When a player touches a checkpoint, that
		checkpoint will light up. Players will return to the illuminated checkpoint when they die
		(even if it is in another room).
- Make some music and sound effects! (If you want to learn to make your own music, then take this
	opportunity to learn about chip-tunes, and compose something fun!)


## Stretch Goals

- Create an overlay map that shows explored areas
- Create more content
